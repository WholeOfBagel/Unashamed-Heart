## “The First Principle for Mortification: It Must Be Continuous”
> Principle I:  The choicest believers, who are assuredly freed from the condemning power of sin, ought yet to make it their business all their days to mortify the indwelling power of sin.

> “Make it your daily work. Be always at it while you live; cease not a day from this work. Be killing sin or it will be killing you!”
1. even for the believer as [[Romans 6.1-7]] establishes
2. [[Romans 13.14]] making no provision for it at any time - this is inevitably a daily work

It is continuous in this sense [[1 Corinthians 9.24-27]] - it requires endurance, it is a race
