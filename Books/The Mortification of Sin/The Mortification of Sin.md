## Introduction
#### Foundation
The necessity, nature, and means of it; with a resolution of various cases of conscience belonging to it
	For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live. [[Romans 8.13]]
1. Duty of mortification
2. Persons applied to: believers
	1. [[Romans 8.1]]: those who have no condemnation
	2. [[Romans 8.9]]: "not in the flesh but in spirit"
	3. Forcing it onto any other group of people is what leads to "superstition and self-righteousness
3. Promise: you shall live
4. Means of acquirement: through the spirit

#### Connection with salvation
Romans 8.13 is not aiming for a cause/effect relationship. It is rather indicating a means/end relationship from the freely given promise of God: "if you use this means, you shall obtain that result; if you do mortify, you shall live”
#### Mortify the Deeds of the Body
##### a. Meaning of body: it is the seat of indwelling sin - the lusts and distempered affections
1. in connection with the body of [[Romans 6.19]] which we were once slaves to lawlessness
	1. but now we push to be slaves to righteousness, resulting in righteousness
2. [[Romans 6.6]] the "body of sin" must be done away with towards this mission of becoming slaves to righteousness in its place

##### b. The deeds of the body
Are to be cut down from where they spring:
* [[Matthew 3.10]] (I agree with this claim though this is a week exegesis)
* [[Romans 8.5-8]] the mind set on flesh is one that has found accord with it
	* if you are unable to subject yourself to the law of God then [[1 John 2.1-6]] you do not know him - there is no faith that can then save

##### c. to "mortify"
> “To kill a man or any other living thing is to take away the principle of all his strength, vigor, and power, so that he cannot act, exert, or put forth any proper actings of his own.”

Most importantly this is seen as a work acted out in degrees, not to some pelagian perfection - but is the constant duty of believers to work out every day.
##### Ye shall live
> “the vigor, power, and comfort of our spiritual life depends on the mortification of the deeds of the flesh." 

As is reflected from the apostles joy in [[1 Thessalonians 3.8]]

But more importantly as we see hammered in through [[Romans 8.5-8]] and [[Galatians 6.8]] the life lived for sin making a practice of it as John would say [[1 John 3.9]]. But rather we sow in spirit, reap of it, and make a practice of it which entails the full conscious efforts to bring about its rightful ends
