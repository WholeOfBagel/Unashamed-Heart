* This is a false presentation of the information.
- He is comparing the eye to the camera.
- Backward wiring = improved oxygen flow
- Verted versus Inverted Retina

## Evolutionist Argument
For a long time the absence of a hypothesis regarding the intruiging nature of the placement of photoreceptors has been a sore point for intelligent design.

## Christain Viewpoints
This is a design constraint revealed by the environments of the organisms being compared

# Synthesis
As found in [Evolution News](https://evolutionnews.org/2018/04/is-the-human-eye-really-evidence-against-intelligent-design/)
> The light-sensing cells in a vertebrate retina require lots of nutrients and vast amounts of energy. In mammals, they have the highest metabolic rate of any tissue in the body.8 About three-quarters of the blood supply to the eye flows through a dense network of capillaries called the “choriocapillaris,” which is situated behind the retina (e in the drawing).9,10 Oxygen and nutrients are transported from the choriocapillaris to the light-sensing cells by an intermediate layer of cells called the “retinal pigment epithelium” (RPE, d in the drawing).

### Terms to know
1. RPE "retinal pigment epithelium": these are the cells that transport nutrients and oxygen to the photoreceptor cells
2. Retinal

### Processes to know
1. The RPE is dark due to the opaqueness of blood, but nerve cells are relatively transparent
2. The blind spot has never experimentally showed itself to be a flaw of human vision.
