Two of my greatest Christian influences being that of [[Michael Jones]] and [[Gavin Ortlund]] are both believers of this position, making great arguments for this belief in accordance to both scripture, history as far back as [[St. Augustine]] 

##### St. Augustine's view
Considered the account of the 7 days to be metaphor according to the awkward chronology of the passage. Though he might not have been a young earth creationist, this is an argument effective against those Christians like [[Ken Ham]] and [[Eric Hovind]] who insist that the only reason Christians have taken the compatibilist position is because they are solely motivated by science.


### Answers in Genesis Misleading 
Often these individuals make the strict literal reading (ironically according to their own reading of the text) as near gospel - making it a "litmus test" as [[Gavin Ortlund]] puts it for faith.
