### Arguments for a regional flood
[A regional take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q07gxxbggJs&ab_channel=InspiringPhilosophy)

#### Scripture referring to all the earth:
1. [[Daniel 2]] **All the earth** where no kingdom has ever ruled over all the earth
2. [[1 Samuel 14.25]] " Now when **all the land** came to the forest, behold, there was honey on the ground"
3. **The whole earth** is at rest and quiet; they break forth into singing" [[Isaiah 14.7]]
4. "moreover, **all the earth** came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth" [[Genesis 41.57]]
5. "If there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on **all the ground**,  then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said"

#### Internal Contradiction
If we take a view that "whole earth" is to be taken literally then we see a direct contradiction in the text:
> "And the waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen." [[Genesis 8.5]]

> "Then he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground. But the dove found no place to set her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth." [[Genesis 8.8-9]]

#### Counter
What if the tops of the mountains were seen through the water?
This is a pretty unnatural reading of the text, introducing additional assumptions. Is one to think that he surveyed all of the mountains from his boat to see the tops of the mountains? Due to the refraction of water you would need to be very close to the mountains to see this, and would likely cause a shipwreck. 

#### Internal Contradiction (Weaker)
Additionally
> "In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried off the earth." [Genesis 8.13]

It makes sense to view this as the water (which was unnaturally flooding the region) being dried up instead off all the waters (oceans) of the earth. 


#### Generations to come
Starting from chapter 10 we see the genealogy is only concerned with those who live in the geography of the Jews. There is no far spread knowledge of the nomadic tribes which we know were traversing the lands of australia, indonesia, etc.
