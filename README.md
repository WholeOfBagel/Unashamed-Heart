# Unashamed-Heart
This is an Obsidian vault of all the notes I am taking regarding a more careful and deliberate analysis of my faith.
Since this is mainly for me to organize my thoughts and research it is not going to be an ultimate source of dogma or truth and will likely be rife with errors in a short period of time. I would love comments, feedback, concern.
