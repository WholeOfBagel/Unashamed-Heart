1. Though my hunger for understanding leaves me wandering from mystery to mystery I must also be patient with God's work in me. Let his miraculous work enact itself in my life, so that this would not be a study of abstraction but faith manifest.


### Why do we toil against sin
1. God has never seen us as automata, he has always seen us as co-partners in sanctification, growth, and glorifying Him. 
	1. Our being made in His is Image is a functional role.
		1. It is not merely Intelligence, Appearance, etc, do not define this point; otherwise, this would not be a uniquely human gift
		2. It is, rather the following:
			1. We are called to be priests, with Adam being the first
			3. We are called to be servants to each other graciously receiving and giving
		3. And by the calling we have we have the faculties to serve that purpose
	2. We are to subdue the earth [[Genesis 1.28]]
2. God has seen it necessary for us to do so, even though he is fully capable of changing us in this way and keeping our wills and autonomy in tact [[1 Corinthians 15.50-57]] which is the fulfillment of [[1 John 1.9]]. However, he has chosen for us to be edified in the patient realization of his love, by directing our attention to him despite the storm.
