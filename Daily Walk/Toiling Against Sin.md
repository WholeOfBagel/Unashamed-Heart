### Why do we toil against sin
1. It is not done out of sinless perfection but a striving for the calling of our new birth. In any matter, whether or not you believe that a Christian can lose their salvation - what is the effectual point except that ONLY Christ can save with our works only being a reflection of the continuation of his work in us.
	1. If we think we can lose our salvation our focus should not be on the consequences of our 
	2. Where does your trust lie? Is it in Christ who guides you or your ability to work for a reward?
3. Jesus died for more than our sins - for more than justification. He died to make us holy, for our good works to be acceptable, with works being reflections of our love and obedience to him.
	1. He died to make us temples [[Matthew 27.51]] -> [[1 Corinthians 6.19]]
	2. [[1 John 2.1-6]] He is the propitiation for our sin, yes. However, he is also the truth that leads us into righteousness, leading us to walk as he did. And especially relevant to the first point, the individual who does walk in the keeping of commandments has "come to know him" AND has the truth in him which is the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
4. God has never seen us as automata, he has always seen us as co-partners in sanctification, growth, and glorifying Him. 
	1. Our being made in His is Image is a functional role.
		1. It is not merely Intelligence, Appearance, etc, do not define this point; otherwise, this would not be a uniquely human gift
		2. It is, rather the following:
			1. We are called to be priests, with Adam being the first
			3. We are called to be servants to each other graciously receiving and giving
		3. And by the calling we have we have the faculties to serve that purpose
	2. We are to subdue the earth [[Genesis 1.28]]
5. God has seen it necessary for us to do so, even though he is fully capable of changing us in this way and keeping our wills and autonomy in tact [[1 Corinthians 15.50-57]] which is the fulfillment of [[1 John 1.9]]. However, he has chosen for us to be edified in the patient realization of his love, by directing our attention to him despite the storm.
	1. [[Philippians 1.8-11]] This is not only how we find righteousness in him [[Died for Our Works]]
	2. [[Luke 9.23]] Taking up our cross is the response to our salvation
		1. [[Philippians 1.21]]
