1. Though my hunger for understanding leaves me wandering from mystery to mystery I must also be patient with God's work in me. Let his miraculous work enact itself in my life, so that this would not be a study of abstraction but faith manifest. Once saved always saved, can you lose it doesn’t matter if you are making a practice of sin.

> Theology is ultimately practical - [[CS Lewis]]
	* espe­cially now. In the old days, when there was less edu­ca­tion and dis­cus­sion, per­haps it was pos­si­ble to get on with a very few sim­ple ideas about God. But it is not so now. Every­one reads, every­one hears things dis­cussed. Con­se­quently, if you do not lis­ten to The­ol­ogy, that will not mean that you have no ideas about God. It will mean that you have a lot of wrong ones — bad, mud­dled, out-of-date ideas. For a great many of the ideas about God which are trot­ted out as novel­ties to-day are simply the ones which real The­olo­gians tried cen­turies ago and rejected.”
