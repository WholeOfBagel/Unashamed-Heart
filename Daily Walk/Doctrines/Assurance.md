> "Whom have I in the heaven but You? And earth has nothing I desire besides You." [[Psalm 73.25]]

Does [[Hebrews 11.1]] mean that we should never doubt? Hardly is this the case, for there are many portions of the bible which tell us to have mercy on those who doubt [[Jude 1.22-25]]. It seems as though doubt, in carrying degrees is ordinary in the walk of genuine Christians; however, it being the constant condition might push one to consider that they are listening to the convictions of their world heart or are being called by the Holy Spirit into conformation.

### Sin
Sin is often the reason for our doubt since it is when we believe in the promises this world offers and pursue that instead of God. Yet, this is precisely when we are to approach God as [[1 John 1.9]], in knowing that despite our unfaithfulness he is still faithful. 

Because it is a challenge that pains us so this is where our faith can grow - using it to propel us into future steadfastness against sin [[James 1.2-4]]. Do not consider your sin a joy, but consider the trial of this life as a joy that God has entrusted you with.

#### For the guilty - Repeated Sin
> For every look at yourself, take ten looks at Christ - [[Rev. Robert Murray McCheyne]]

[[Micah 7.7-10]] this battle is had every day, every hour. Lest you believe you are the foremost of sinners [[1 Timothy 1.15]], this is not a debate of who is reprobate. Jesus died for all and the salvation that was being waited is here, advocating for you. If you have breath in your lungs as you read this, there is no burden so inescapable that his perfect sacrifice cannot bear. His is not a rage we face by repeating lofty words to feel loved; it is one we feel as his word pierces us as he recreates us. We betrayed God believing in the promises of this world instead of the promise of our dearly bought life in Him. 

However, let us not approach this as though our salvation is won through our works. Though all feeling may be tossing us up and over, we must be sober in the realization of [[1 John 3.19-20]]. Why do we have this incessant draw to judge ourselves. No, let God be our judge [[Psalm 139.23-24]], let him be our partner in accountability and truth. Where we give up on ourselves he does not. Where we would hope to hide our sin - he sees. Moreover, where we sin and confess, not knowing what lie we have stolen within ourselves and how to root it out - he answers with his wisdom in time. Let us be kept by Him in our pursuit of his righteousness so that god knowing all that we need will provide it so that we may bear these same sins and grow [[James 1.2-4]].

#### License to Sin
This is not a license to sin [[Romans 6.1-7]], in fact it is a beautiful description of why Christians do what they do. We are wearing the
