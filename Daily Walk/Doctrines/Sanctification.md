## From [The Doctrine of Sanctification, Part 3 - Dr. J.I. Packer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARICHzVqON4&t=1184s&ab_channel=DutchReformed%2778)

### What is Sanctification 
> "Sanctification is the work of the Christian's God. The work of God changing us, transforming us, making us Christ like, making us we may properly say, fit for his company."
> - [[Dr. JI Packer]]

This beautifully aligns with: [[Philippians 2.13]] for it truly is God's work

What is its goal: [[1 Thessalonians 5.23-24]] this work of grace is what all Christians look to

### What are it's Qualities:
By [[Galatians5.22-24]] we see it is the nine qualities of: 
	- love,
	- joy, 
	- peace, 
	- patience, 
	- kindness, 
	- goodness, 
	- faithfulness,
	- gentleness,Â 
	- self-control
	
as qualities for those who have crucified themselves with Christ - this links with [[Romans 6.6]]:
	- The whole "body of sin" in all of its totality - in every expression must be:
		- put to death
		- put away
	- Such that we are no longer slaves to sin, not making a practice of it [[1 John 3.9]], but being at war with it.

**Combining the striving for God and the [[Toiling Against Sin]]**
By fruit of the spirit working in us, we are able to die more to sin and live more to righteousness. 

### The Life of Five Things - The Christian Life 
1. Obedience [[Romans 16.26]] - fulfilling the desires of the spirit
2. Resistance [[Galatians 5.16]] - resisting the desires of the flesh
3. Imitation of God the Father, imitation of God the Son [[Ephesians 5.1-2]]
4. Walking in love: love to God out of gratitude, and to men out of goodwill
5. Life of communion to God - more than moral superiority
	1. This must be at the center or everything is pharisaic [[Ephesians 2.8-9]]

In this way, though we should always be thankful for the justification through Christ - we should never forget the rest of the salvation that is built on it. This work of sanctification is the work of glorification begun. 
	Isn't this works based? No. 
	
	"There is a connection between the way you go and the place you arrive. There is a connection between the service you render and the reward you get. If you serve sin, that is traveling along the road which leads to sin's reward, sins wages: death... But if you serve God, if you serve Christ, if you serve righteousness, if you live in obedient response to the God who has loved you and forgiven your sins, then you are on the path which leads to the fullness of life." - Dr. J.I. Packer

1. We are not working for something. "We are walking in the direction that allows us to receive God's gift." - Dr. JI Packer which is a mirror of [[Romans 6.22-23]] in response to the question of wether we should sin or not.
	This is how the gift is received, and because we have so often ignored that we are free to sin, we doubt our [[Assurance]]. Thus, in Romans 6 we see that Paul is rebutting the argument of "what would it matter if I sin" because it is this course of sanctification in which we receive the gift of Christ. So if your life is truly a miraculous gift through faith (which is known in its quality of perseverance) how is it that we reject it? For we see that salvation and the work of sanctification are the same gift.
