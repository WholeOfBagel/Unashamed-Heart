Romans 4 - Abraham saved by faith

## Evidence Texts
1. [[Romans 5.1]]





## Though we are Saved
There is still the race. Shall we be disqualified by our unbelief? Let it not be so that we shipwreck our faith by not letting it have it's due course which is that of producing endurance [[James 1.2-4]] such that we have the strength to surmount every storm that besets us.
