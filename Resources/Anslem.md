“There can be another explanation, besides the one I offered [in Cur Deus Homo], for how God took a sinless human being out of the sinful mass of the human race. . . . After all, nothing prohibits there being a plurality of reasons for one and the same thing, any one of which can be sufficient in itself.
—Anselm”
