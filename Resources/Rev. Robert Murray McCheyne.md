Cry after divine knowledge and lift up your voice for understanding. Seek her as silver, and search for her as hid treasure, according to the word in [Proverbs 2:4](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Prov%202.4). See that verse 10 be fulfilled in you. Let wisdom _enter into your hearts,_ and knowledge _be pleasant to thy soul;_ so, you will be delivered from the snares mentioned in the following verses.

Let your soul be filled with a heart-ravishing sense of the sweetness and excellency of Christ and all that is in Him. Let the Holy Spirit fill every chamber of your heart; and so there will be no room for folly, or the world, or Satan, or the flesh.

I must now commend you all to God and the word of His grace. My dear people are just assembled for worship. Alas! I cannot preach to them tonight. I can only carry them and you on my heart to the throne of grace. Write me soon. Ever yours, etc.
