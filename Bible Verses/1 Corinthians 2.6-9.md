6 Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; 7 but we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden _wisdom_ which God predestined before the ages to our glory; 8 _the wisdom_ which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; 9 but just as it is written:

“Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard,  
And _which_ have not entered the human heart,  
All that God has prepared for those who love Him.”
