## NASB Text

> Who is a God like You, who pardons wrongdoing  
	And passes over a rebellious act of the remnant of His possession?  
	He does not retain His anger forever,  
	Because He delights in mercy.  
	19 He will again take pity on us;  
	He will trample on our wrongdoings.  
	Yes, You will cast all their sins  
	Into the depths of the sea.  
	20 You will give truth to Jacob  
	_And_ favor to Abraham,  
	Which You swore to our forefathers  
	From the days of old.
