## NASB Text

> But as for me, I will be on the watch for the Lord;  
	I will wait for the God of my salvation.
	My God will hear me.  
	8 Do not rejoice over me, enemy of mine.  
	Though I fall I will rise;  
	Though I live in darkness, the Lord is a light for me.
	9 I will endure the rage of the Lord  
	Because I have sinned against Him,  
	Until He pleads my case and executes justice for me.  
	He will bring me out to the light,  
	_And_ I will look at His righteousness.  
	10 Then my enemy will see,  
	And shame will cover her who said to me,  
	“Where is the Lord your God?”  
	My eyes will look at her;  
	At that time she will be trampled down  
	Like mud of the streets.
