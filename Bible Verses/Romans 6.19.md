## NASB Text

> 19 I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented the parts of your body as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness, resulting in further lawlessness, so now present your bodyâ€™s parts as slaves to righteousness, resulting in sanctification.
