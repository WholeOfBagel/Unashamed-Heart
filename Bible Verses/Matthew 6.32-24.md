## NASB Text

> 32 For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 33 But seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be provided to you.
> 
> 34 “So do not worry about tomorrow; for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
