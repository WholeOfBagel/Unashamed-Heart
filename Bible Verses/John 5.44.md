## NASB Text

> How can you believe, when you accept glory from one another and you do not seek the glory that is from the one and only God?

## Importance
For me this establishes that if you are not humble in your manner - if you seek to prove yourself as something which you are not - you accept a glory that is apart from God. To be unashamed in simply exalting God in every blessing. If every good thing is truly from the Lord and you being in possession of this lay claim to it as simply a matter of creation we praise creation instead of the Lord. So when you see brilliance, kindness, joy in others who are apart from God we should still bring praise to God for this.
