## NASB Text

> 12 Not that I have already grasped _it all_ or have already become perfect, but I press on if I may also take hold of that for which I was even taken hold of by Christ Jesus. 13 Brothers _and sisters_, I do not regard myself as having taken hold of _it yet_; but one thing _I do_: forgetting what _lies_ behind and reaching forward to what _lies_ ahead, 14 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. 15 Therefore, all who are mature, let’s have this attitude; and if in anything you have a different attitude, God will reveal that to you as well; 16 however, let’s keep living by that same _standard_ to which we have attained.
