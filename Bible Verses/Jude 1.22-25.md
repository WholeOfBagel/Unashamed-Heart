## NASB Text

> 22 And have mercy on some, who are doubting; 23 save others, snatching them out of the fire; and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the garment polluted by the flesh. 24 Now to Him who is able to protect you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of His glory, blameless with great joy, 25 to the [only](obsidian://open?vault=Unashamed-Heart&file=Bible%20Verses%2FJohn%205.44) God our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, _be_ glory, majesty, dominion, and authority before all time and now and forever. Amen.
