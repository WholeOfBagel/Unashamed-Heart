## NASB Text

> God certainly is good to Israel,
	To those who are pure in heart!
	2 But as for me, my feet came close to stumbling,
	My steps had almost slipped.
	3 For I was envious of the arrogant
	As I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
	4 For there are no pains in their death,
	And their belly is fat.
	5 They are not in trouble like other people,
	Nor are they tormented together with the rest of mankind.
	6 Therefore arrogance is their necklace;
	The garment of violence covers them.
	7 Their eye bulges from fatness;
	The imaginations of their heart overflow.
	8 They mock and wickedly speak of oppression;
	They speak from on high.
	9 They have set their mouth against the heavens,
	And their tongue parades through the earth.
	10 Therefore his people return here,
	And abundant waters are drunk by them.
	
> 11 They say, “How does God know?
	And is there knowledge with the Most High?”
	12 Behold, these are the wicked;
	And always at ease, they have increased in wealth.
	13 Surely in vain I have kept my heart pure
	And washed my hands in innocence;
	14 For I have been stricken all day long,
	And punished every morning.
