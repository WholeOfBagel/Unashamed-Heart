#Moorean-Shift
# Moorean Shift
Moore does not attack the skeptical premise; instead, he reverses the argument from being in the form of [modus ponens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens "Modus ponens") to [modus tollens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens "Modus tollens"). This logical maneuver is often called a G. E. Moore shift or a Moorean shift**. This is captured clearly in [Fred Dretske](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Dretske "Fred Dretske")'s aphorism that "one man's _modus ponens_ is another man's _modus tollens_" [[2]] His response takes the following form:

- If _S_ doesn't know that not-_sp_, then _S_ doesn't know that _q_
- _S_ knows that _q_
- Therefore, _S_ knows that not-_sp_

# Review on effectivenesss
On its surface this can seem dismissive. However Michael Jones would argue that this is indicative of many philosophical arguments.
From what I understand we cannot gather the necessity of a truth or falsehood from intuition; however, they are where we start. Perhaps more importantly they are often how we function. 

###### Definition
[1] "Like perceptions philosophical intuitions provide a noninferential defense, defeasible justificationary foundation in at least the following way: a person may appeal to intuition as evidence without having to provide further evidence for the intuition." 
[2] "Intuition is not a belief it is not a judgement or any other doxastic statement. It is not a tendency or disposition to endorse a proposition. It is not a guess it is not a hunch it is not a suposition. It is not a facility of any sort neither is it fallible either is it epistemically justifiable or unjustifiable. It is a concious experiential state..."- Russ Shafer-Landau

The second point can be employed to the case of the Nuremberg Trials - on what grounds did we have to condemn the Nazi's?
