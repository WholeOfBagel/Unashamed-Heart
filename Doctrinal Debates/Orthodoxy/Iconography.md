# Argument from History
## Iconoclast view of history

From the point of view of the [Gavin Ortlund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ytYX4dXpRo&ab_channel=TruthUnites) this is the clear point of view of early Christians. From a person of such nuance and consideration I would say that this is damning for the iconophile. 

### Conversations with Orthodox Christians
1. They would not trust Trent Horn (although they respect him for being a genuine interlocutor)
	1. especially on matters of iconography
2. Strange foreign positions to Christianity, starting with assumptions:
	1. Church needs to undergo triage (and they don't see why it needs to undergo this)
	2. Sorts theological issues on order of priority to determine what the church is and isn't
		1. what can we disagree about and still be Christian (begs the question)
		2. how do we know something is of first rank importance?
3. Guise of loving charity (could be potentially deceiving)
	1. We just live in a pluralistic society
4. On what authority does he rely on for his interpretation of the Ark of the Covenant not being an Icon - this point is heavily stooped in their tradition and it is the first time they heard someone put it to question
	1. The church as a necessary source for this
5. They don't like Dr. Jordan B Cooper very much - he is operating mostly off of misunderstanding they claim

9. We are icons ourselves
#### Review of conversation
In all honesty, I believe these to be genuine believers though they seem mainly to focus on the point that Gavin is in outright denial of the traditions and therefore cannot see the importance of venerating icons.
