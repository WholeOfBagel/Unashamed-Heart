### Introduction with Joshua Schooping
A good start is [[Gavin Ortlund]]'s [conversation with Joshua Schooping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft4p2h6fTOM&t=759s&ab_channel=TruthUnites)
#### Exclusivism
1. Should we not judge a church by its fruits?
2. These questions quickly spiral into historical/scriptural arguments that take great deal of study to understand - since a person's judgment is used to find what church they will go to does this not exclude those who would otherwise would have a valid profession of faith
3. Does "oneness of mind and spirit" really mean that we are in "bureaucratic lockstep"?

### [[Assurance]] of faith
1. This is not something that should be based in ecclesiology - it is founded in Christ

#### The Unchanging Church - Infallibility
1. Justin Martyr vs Cyril of Alexandria vs John of Damascus
2. Always venerating [[Iconography]] - this does not appear to be the case 
	1. Every apologist of this age has some section that images are foolish
	2. Transfer from what is seen has yet to be grounded as a theological concept
	3. It is not an argument from science - it is an argument of force
		1. why would you condemn something that you do correctly? Would not that contrast be important
	4. John of Damascus is one example of them starting to incorporate iconography
		1. just because Jesus is incarnated that doesn't mean we worship the image of him - it is a non-sequitur 
	5. Architectural evidence - doesn't prove anything about their usage
	6. You must have affection for these icons
		1. otherwise you are damned to hell as 
		2. they either mean it or they don't - it is forced or the church is not unchanging
	7. The spirit of the new church is freedom
	8. Why would there not be immediate and powerful clarification in scripture about this issue if it was so central?
		1. It is the second commandment, as the fulfillment of the law should we not have received some clarification?
	9. it externalizes the fact that God lives within us now
3. The councils have unchanging ruling 
	1. if you don't accept this you are rejecting christ
4. Bishops of Nicea II are making up evidence, misquoting Basil
#### Mariology
1. canonical hymns 
2. half of the feasts to Mary half to jesus
	1. the beginning and the end feasts are to Mary
3. concept of you cannot approach Jesus unless you go through Mary
4. Is Mary leading us closer to Jesus instead of displacing him?
	1. there are soteriological roles being given to her that exclusively belong to Christ in what was done at calvary
