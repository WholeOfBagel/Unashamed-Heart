This is a topic that warrants precision - the church has always been careful to define the trinity in such a way that is not contradictory. Here I itemize the views that I have found helpful, convincing, or curious.
### Definitions
The [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/trinity/) Does a great job at defining selves, deity, and modes.

### My Understanding: One-Self Trinitarianism
An understanding from RC Sproul. RC's main claim is that God as the singular being is one in essence, but three in person. This is also reflected in the [[Nicene Creed]].
#### [[CS Lewis]]: The Three-Personal God
##### How Christianity Differs from Other Religions
* we are not a drop of water that is to meet the ocean
	* this belief of final union with the "goldy" source is equivalent to ceasing to be 
		* In fact, this is why Christians need to be firm on the fact that sanctification is a process of becoming more like Christ - but only insofar as our lives reflect his truth:
			* Christians are not becoming god
			* Christians have their sins imputed to Christ so that they can enter His Holy presence
		* Whatever this is, a mixing of consciousness or matter - it seems to me that this concept is the loss of self
			* This makes sense from a perspective that does not consider man to be made in the Image of God
	* 

#### Example from Dimensionally
This is the most comforting example that I have worked through that gave me solace in seeking an unfathomable God. CS Lewis put it most powerfully in that humans carry a certain assumption that a person in which one can have a relationship necessarily 


I Have heard this argument repeated by Michael Jones to the same effect.
