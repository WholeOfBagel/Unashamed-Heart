The use of [[Matthew 16.19]] is a foundational source for the argument for binding and loosing being a matter of demonic or heavenly influence/warfare.

This statement is made in the context of Peter proclaiming that Jesus is the Son of God.
Peter's keys are about accessing Christ as we will later see that the Gentiles come to Christ through Peter in Acts 10. For what was forbidden in [[Acts 10.28]] is now open since upon the revelation that what god cleans is no longer unholy.
