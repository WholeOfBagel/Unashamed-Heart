# Introduction

##### Timeline
1. Got introduced to this topic by 3+ hours of conversation with Eastern Orthodox Christians (Ephraim from the server Orthodox Christian was my main interlocutor)
2. [Gavin Ortlund Vs.Trent Horn: Is Sola Scriptura True](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn7qdPSHSJk&ab_channel=PintsWithAquinas)
3. And then followed it up with: [Gavin's review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-O18bhDPGc&t=567s&ab_channel=TruthUnites) (still working through this)

# Arguments from Scripture
## [[2 Timothy 3.16-17]] Every Good work
### Theopneustos: "God Breathed"
From Gavin's review: The very root is Theos "God" + and the rest "God aspired"

### Questions I have
1. Is "Every Good Work" limited to just the work of sanctification or does it also apply to salvation?
	1. I think there is a distinction from man's works and the works of God
2. 

## Apostles Infallible?
### [[Acts 15.39]] Paul vs Barnabas 
#### Questions
1. Was their disagreement material?
2. Does it show that the apostles have some degree of infallibility?
	1. I believe the answer to be yes - even though this is a weak starting point it got me thinking of the following:

### [[Galatians 1.6-9]] Do no listen to us IF
This was something that was brought up by Gavin in the debate that made substantial headway in proving his point. I think from this we can see that the authority of angels, and even Paul himself is not infallible - this in my opinion is sufficient to put sheer apostolic succession to rest as necessary and sufficient to shepherd interpretation and doctrine.

#### Questions
1. The remaining question is the interpretation of what is a contrary gospel? (hint hint works based salvation)
## Are Councils Infallible?
### Councils of Apostles

### Ecumenical councils



# Implicitly Acquired Arguments
## Is there something that is infallible apart from scripture
At least from the Trent Horn interview I am not convinced that it is, although I did think that the retort of "a fallible list of infallible doctrines" did gain him some distance.

## Ontological Uniqueness
Even though we would say there is an element of the word of God being more than just scripture is true. Protestants would say above that is the ontological uniqueness of the scripture.
