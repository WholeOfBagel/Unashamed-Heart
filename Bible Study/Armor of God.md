# Ephesians 6:10-16

> 10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.

As we are no longer our own - relying on the strength and truth of the Almighty God - there is a sense that we can acquire a certain passivity in allowing [[Romans 8.28]] be the answer to any circumstance. However, it is my belief that from 
 
> 11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes of the devil. 

The schemes of the devil are deception. 

> 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual _forces_ of wickedness in the heavenly _places_. 



> 13 Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you will be able to resist on the evil day, and having done everything, to stand firm. 


> 14 Stand firm therefore, having belted your waist with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 


> 15 and having strapped on your feet the preparation of the gospel of peace; 


> 16 in addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil _one_. 

Appealing back to verse 11 the schemes of the devil which are deception come at us like arrows. The way these barbs can stick within us is if we BELIEVE them.

> 17 And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
