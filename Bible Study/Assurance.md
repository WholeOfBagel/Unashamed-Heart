Does [[Hebrews 11.1]] mean that we should never doubt? Hardly is this the case, for there are many portions of the bible which tell us to have mercy on those who doubt [[Jude 1.22-25]]. It seems as though doubt, in carrying degrees is ordinary in the walk of genuine Christians; however, 

### Sin
Sin is often the reason for our doubt since it is when we believe in the promises this world offers and pursue that instead of God. Yet, this is precisely when we are to approach God as [[1 John 1.9]], in knowing that despite our unfaithfulness he is still faithful. 

Because it is a challenge that pains us so this is where our faith can grow - using it to propel us into future steadfastness against sin [[James 1.2-4]]. Do not consider your sin a joy, but consider the trial of this life as a joy that God has entrusted you with.

#### For the guilty
[[Micah 7.7-10]]
