In the introduction to the chapter it is clear that Paul is making a point to commend them for the blessing of knowledge and wisdom which abounds amongst them. However, points out that they have trusted the arm of the flesh too much - we almost see the doctrinal focus of this [[1 Corinthians 1.12-13]].

There is a certain cost that occurs when we puff up our speech such that the cross of Christ is diminished. [[1 Corinthians 1.17]]. It is precisely this that God condemns with the foolish wisdom of the world. 

From the little comes the great [[1 Corinthians 1.27]].

What is Christ to us? He is:
* #wisdom
* #righteousness
* #sanctification
* #redemption

But why is this brought up in the case of those with a boastful heart?
* His wisdom to remind us of our deception. Of the mind's efforts to leave the God we love.
* His righteousness as apart from our own. No good deed can outweigh the evil of a man's sin, and no evil deed can tear us from his grasp.
* His sanctification, we do not grow by our own strains but in all call upon him to reveal to us himself.
* Redemption - light unto the world.
