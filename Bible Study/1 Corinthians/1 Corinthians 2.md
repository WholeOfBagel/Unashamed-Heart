Resting on the #power of God. Let the gospel do what it is intended. Do not steal away from it man [[1 Corinthians 2.4-5]].

However, we are not gnostics so as to say that man is unable to see his #wisdom as [[1 Corinthians 2.6-9]]
* There is a certain sense here that not all of God's truths are revealed in creation; thus calling for the need to spread the Gospel. General revelation will leave some still wandering in their deception.

Verses 10-16 are some of the most powerful arguments regarding God's deeply relational aspect with us and his Spirit.
