### Fulfilled Prophecy?
39Â And after you another kingdom will arise inferior to you, then another third kingdom of bronze, which will rule over all the earth.
As we were discussing the topic of the prophecy of the statue which is commonly interpreted as the Medo Persians -> Greeks (under Alexander the Great) -> Romans conquering the realm of Babylon - it is clear that we never had a kingdom rule over all the earth. This along with many other parts of the bible are indicative of the world/earth referring to that which concern's God's kingdom & elect (in this time being the Jews).
