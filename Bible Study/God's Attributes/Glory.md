## Christian Hedonism
> "God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him" - John Piper

The conversation of God's jealously and wrath are much in the same. There is a clear sense in which human wrath (as children of wrath) is born from a hatred of that which is good - it is selfish and destructive. While God's jealousy is expressed God's desire for us to join him since he is the origin of all that is good. God's jealousy should not be separated from his love because in a true sense it is one and the same. It is also a byproduct of God being absolute truth, we are to "settle for nothing less than the completion of our joy in him" [John Piper](https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/god-is-most-glorified-in-us-when-we-are-most-satisfied-in-him) as a principle
