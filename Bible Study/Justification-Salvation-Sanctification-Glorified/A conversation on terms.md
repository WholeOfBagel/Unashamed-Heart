A survey of systematic theology will tell you that salvation has three basic parts:
* justification (initial moment you "get saved from the penalty of sin"), 
* sanctification (process of "getting saved from the power of sin"), 
* and glorification (end state of "being saved from the presence of sin")
	* does not impinge on free will - how does libertarian free will align with this?

Work does not mean any action
* it is pointing to works of the law
